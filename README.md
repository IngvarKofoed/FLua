This is me learning F# by implementing a parser for some yet unspecified language (lua). 

Im starting from the very very very basics by implementing a RegEx parser and then a RegEx evaluator that is going to be used by my hand writting parser.

The goal is to get to know F# really good and not to produce a fancy, pretty or production ready parser...

This is me learning F# by implementing a parser for some yet unspecified language (lua). 

The goal is to get to know F# really good and not to produce a fancy, pretty or production ready parser...

I changed my strategy to be inspired by the FParsec project and implement a small subset of FParsec by using the concept and idea in FParsec and looking at the function types.
I will use this small reimplementation of FParsec to make a lua parser.
